# Whisper

This project is a chat application built using Django Channels and WebSocket protocol. It allows multiple users to join a chat room and send and receive messages in real-time.



## Working

When a user joins the chat room, the user is assigned a unique WebSocket channel, and the user's messages are sent through this channel. Other users in the same chat room can listen to this channel and receive the messages.
## Tools

The tools used in this project are Django, Django Channels, WebSocket, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Django is a high-level Python web framework used for rapid development, and Django Channels is an extension that allows the use of WebSockets and asynchronous code in Django. WebSocket is a protocol that provides a two-way communication channel between a client and a server over a single TCP connection. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are used to create the frontend of the chat application.
